# Contributing
Hi, thanks for taking a look at the Contributing Guide for the tempylate repository!
I hope you will follow what is written here when contributing.

## Code
The code in tempylate is a bit PEP8 compliant.  
When writing code, please observe the following.

* Keep it within 99 characters per line.
* Use mypy to make it type safe.
* Don't break the style of the code that can be seen throughout.
* Write code that is roughly compliant with [this](https://gist.github.com/tasuren/bf1fcce48f1e23a5c7e6abd503bdb3c1).

(If it differs slightly, I will fix it later, so there is no need to try to be fully compliant.)

## Issue
Please be clear about what you are talking about when you create an Issue.  
If you have questions about how to code, etc., please ask on StackOverflow.
Only issues related to tempylate are allowed.

## PullRequest
Even if you don't have an issue, it's OK.  
Please feel free to request new features, etc. (I don't guarantee that your request will be approved.  
(I'm not saying that your request will be approved.)
